# JAX_simulations

These simulations are implemented with JAX. Developed by Google, Jax is a Python library that is specifically designed for ML research. Unlike Tensorflow and PyTorch, it is built with the functional programming (FP) paradigm, making it highly composable and promoting the concept of pure functions that have no side effects. This means that all state changes, such as parameter updates or splitting of random generators, must be done explicitly. Although this may require more lines of code than their object-oriented programming (OOP) equivalent, it gives developers full control over state changes, leading to an increased understanding of the code and fewer surprises.
